Given a list of category ids, slugs, or names, this plugin creates a list of
all posts that can be filtered by their tags.

Description
===========

FastFilter only has a few settings. The plugin works through shortcodes, like
this:

`[fastfilter categories="1,my_cat,My Cat"]`

The categories listed can be identified by the category ID, the category name,
or the category slug.

Note that for now I'm only supporting three themes. If you want to change the
appearance of the plugin, try editing PLUGIN_DIR/assets/css/_frontend.css
directly.

Installation
============

1. Download the plugin
2. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your
   WordPress dashboard
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
